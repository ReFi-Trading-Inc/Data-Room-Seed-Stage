# Founding Story

## The Problem That Started It All

For years, Zeshan Ahmad and Daniel Oosthuyzen independently experienced the same frustration: they both knew *what* to do in the markets from a technical perspective, but consistently failed to execute due to emotional decision-making.

**Zeshan's Experience:**  
Zeshan’s exposure to markets began early. His father was a stockbroker, and his earliest memories were punching ticker symbols into a Bloomberg terminal in his father’s office.  
He later worked on electronic trading floors starting in 2001 with a family office that became the largest holder of E*TRADE after selling their trading platform into New York’s early day-trading boom.  
He then supported Symstream in building 2G wireless signal processing systems and licensing the technology to ATM manufacturer Diebold Nixdorf, enabling secure financial transactions over 2G networks across Australia, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Singapore.  
While trading equities and crypto, he followed structured rules and clear strategies yet broke those rules during stress, holding losers too long, taking profits too early, and chasing losses.  
He deepened expertise in software engineering, cryptography, blockchain, and smart contracts, and began teaching these subjects as a professor. Participation in Outlier Ventures’ Web3 accelerator and the Chainlink Build program expanded his understanding of decentralized infrastructure, risk, and compliance.

**Daniel's Experience:**  
Daniel built quantitative systems inside hedge fund environments. He specialized in modern portfolio theory, optimal allocation, systematic rebalancing, and reinforcement learning for continuous markets.  
Through his platform thinkquant, he published material on position sizing, Kelly Criterion applications, derivatives risk, and how uncertainty and reward interact across long horizons.  
He developed strong backtested models supported by robust engineering around data pipelines and execution. Yet when real capital was deployed, emotional bias pulled him away from systematic behavior.  
“I would see a losing streak and shut a strategy down, then see a strong run and over-leverage,” he explains. “Emotion kept pulling me away from disciplined execution.”

## The "Aha" Moment

The two knew each other through the Alberta tech community, where Daniel presented research on reward-centered reinforcement learning for sequential decision-making. In early 2025, Zeshan reached out with a simple question:

“If agents defeat human players in Go and StarCraft, why are traders still clicking buy and sell based on gut feelings?”

Daniel’s answer reframed the problem:  
“Most trading automation relies on discounted-reward models assuming finite episodes. Markets behave as infinite-horizon processes. The math and objectives are misaligned.”

Over several technical deep dives, they outlined the foundations of ReFi.Trading:

1. **Average-reward RL agents** tuned for infinite-horizon markets  
2. **Non-custodial execution** through REST APIs connected to user-owned broker accounts  
3. **Browser-based automation** that removes installation friction and expands access globally  
4. **Transparent risk management** using cryptographic proof-of-risk  
5. **Portfolio-level logic** rooted in modern portfolio theory and systematic rebalancing  
6. **Regulatory-first architecture** aligned with ADGM and global compliance  

“We saw no platform that combined these elements,” Zeshan says. “It needed to exist.”

## From Idea to Alpha (March–December 2025)

### Phase 1: Rapid Validation (March–April 2025)
- Built a prototype RL agent using RVI-Q  
- Backtested on 3.1 years of equity and crypto data  
- Achieved 28.06% CAGR and a 2.07 Sharpe ratio  
- Confirmed average-reward RL outperforms discounted models in continuous markets  

### Phase 2: Incorporation & Architecture (May–July 2025)
- Incorporated ReFi.Trading Inc. in Alberta, Canada  
- Designed a non-custodial execution layer over broker REST APIs  
- Added VaR limits, progressive caps, and hard kill switches  
- Selected UAE ADGM for licensing  
- Joined AMII Scale-Up, VentureLab AI Accelerate, and Google for Startups  

### Phase 3: MVP Development (August–October 2025)
- Built the MVP web platform  
- Integrated with IBKR, Questrade, Kraken, and Coinbase through SnapTrade  
- Released paper-trading onboarding  
- Filed a USPTO patent for a non-custodial zk-VaR RL execution system  
- Drafted five patent families for future IP  

### Phase 4: Alpha Prep & Fundraising (November–December 2025)
- Finalized the paper-trading MVP  
- Built a 90-day alpha acquisition plan  
- Completed an investor data room  
- Prepared ADGM Category 3A license documents  
- Opened a $2.45M seed round at a $15M post-money valuation  

## The "Why Now?" Inflection Point

### 1. Post-FTX Trust Crisis  
Demand for non-custodial systems increased sharply.

### 2. AI Democratization  
Open-source RL frameworks, GPUs, and cloud compute reduced barriers.

### 3. Regulatory Clarity  
ADGM and other regulators built clear licensing paths for non-custodial automation.

“We accelerated because the environment finally aligned,” Zeshan explains.

## The Vision: Democratizing Quant Trading

**The Old World (2010–2020):**  
- Automation accessible only to hedge funds  
- Retail traders forced into discretionary or custodial tools  

**The New World (2025+):**  
- Open-source RL  
- Non-custodial broker APIs  
- Browser-based automation  
- Clear regulatory frameworks  

“We are not building a bot,” Daniel says. “We are building quant infrastructure for retail.”

## Mission Statement

**ReFi.Trading exists to give retail traders hedge-fund-grade automation, transparency, and discipline—without giving up custody, safety, or compliance.**

Core beliefs:

- **Custody belongs to users**  
- **Execution must be systematic**  
- **Risk must be transparent**  
- **Regulation must be integrated**  
- **Advanced tools should be accessible globally**  

## What Drives Us

**Zeshan:**  
“I want people anywhere in the world to access structured, disciplined trading tools once limited to institutions. Background and location should never limit access to safe, rule-based automation.”

**Daniel:**  
“Markets reward structure and consistency. My work in portfolio theory, reinforcement learning, and risk modeling made one thing clear: good math is not enough. Traders need systems that enforce discipline when uncertainty rises. That is how you close the gap between intention and action.”

**The Team:**  
“We built the platform we needed. Every feature maps back to a lived problem.”

## What's Next

- **Q4 2025:** Alpha launch, paper trading, seed fundraising  
- **Q1 2026:** ADGM license filing  
- **Q2 2026:** Live trading and first revenue  
- **Q3 2026:** Marketplace beta, APAC expansion  
- **Q4 2026:** $3M ARR milestone, Series A preparation  

“In ten years,” Zeshan says, “2025 will be remembered as the moment retail automation became mainstream.”
