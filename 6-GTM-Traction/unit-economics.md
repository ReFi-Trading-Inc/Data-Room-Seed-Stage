# Unit Economics & Customer Metrics

## Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Blended CAC Target:** $50-$100 per paid subscriber

**Channel-Specific CAC:**

| Channel | CAC | Conversion Rate | Payback Period | Notes |
|---------|-----|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| **Organic Content** | $20-$30 | 6-8% | 2 months | TikTok, Reddit, blog posts |
| **Influencer Partnerships** | $40-$60 | 12-15% | 3 months | Finfluencer sponsorships |
| **Paid Ads (TikTok/Twitter)** | $80-$120 | 3-5% | 6 months | Test Phase 1, scale winners |
| **Reddit AMAs** | $15-$25 | 10-12% | 1 month | High intent, low cost |
| **Community/Discord** | $10-$20 | 15-20% | 1 month | Referrals, word-of-mouth |
| **SEO/Content Marketing** | $5-$15 | 4-6% | 12 months | Long-term, compounding |

**Blended Mix (Year 1):**
- Organic: 60% of users → $24 weighted CAC
- Influencer: 25% of users → $12.50 weighted CAC
- Paid: 10% of users → $10 weighted CAC
- Community: 5% of users → $0.75 weighted CAC
- **Total Blended CAC: $47.25**

**CAC Efficiency Improvement:**
- Month 1-6: $100 CAC (learning phase, paid ads heavy)
- Month 7-12: $60 CAC (organic flywheel building)
- Year 2: $40 CAC (content library, SEO, referrals kicking in)
- Year 3: $30 CAC (brand recognition, network effects)

## Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Base Case LTV:** $3,600

**Assumptions:**
- Average monthly subscription: $120 (mix of $99 Basic, $299 Pro, $999 Enterprise)
- Average customer lifetime: 30 months
- Gross margin: 75%

**Calculation:**
- Monthly revenue: $120
- Lifetime: 30 months
- Gross revenue: $120 × 30 = $3,600
- Gross profit: $3,600 × 0.75 = $2,700 (contribution margin LTV)

**LTV by Tier:**

| Tier | Monthly Price | Avg Lifetime | Gross LTV | % of Base |
|------|---------------|--------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Basic** | $99 | 24 months | $2,376 | 60% of users |
| **Pro** | $299 | 36 months | $10,764 | 30% of users |
| **Enterprise** | $999+ | 48 months | $47,952 | 10% of users |
| **Blended** | $120 | 30 months | $3,600 | Weighted avg |

**LTV Expansion Opportunities:**
1. **Upsell to Pro:** 25% of Basic users upgrade within 6 months → +$7,200 LTV
2. **Marketplace revenue:** Users who publish strategies earn 70%, we take 30% → +$500-$2,000 LTV
3. **Performance fees:** Fund-level accounts pay 10-15 bps on volume → +$1,000-$5,000 LTV
4. **Token staking:** $REFI stakers receive rebates, creating lock-in → +10% retention = +$360 LTV

## LTV:CAC Ratio

**Target Ratio:** 36:1 to 72:1

**Year 1:** 
- LTV: $3,600
- CAC: $100 (early stage)
- Ratio: **36:1** ✓

**Year 3 (Mature):**
- LTV: $3,600 (conservative, likely higher with upsells)
- CAC: $50 (organic + network effects)
- Ratio: **72:1** ✓

**Industry Benchmarks:**
- SaaS healthy: 3:1
- SaaS excellent: 5:1+
- ReFi.Trading: **36-72:1** (exceptional)

**Why Our Ratio is High:**
1. **Sticky product:** Trading automation has high switching costs
2. **Network effects:** Marketplace creates lock-in
3. **Low churn:** Users with profitable strategies don't leave
4. **Organic growth:** Content compounds, referrals reduce CAC
5. **High margin:** 75% gross margin vs typical SaaS 60-70%

## Payback Period

**Target:** 3-6 months

**Calculation:**
- CAC: $100 (Year 1 blended)
- Monthly gross profit: $120 × 0.75 = $90
- Payback: $100 / $90 = **1.1 months** ✓

**Reality Check:**
- Assumes immediate subscription conversion
- Actual: 60% convert from paper to paid within 3 months
- Adjusted payback: 3-4 months for most users

**Cash Flow Positive Timeline:**
- Month 1: CAC spend = $15K (150 users × $100)
- Month 4: Revenue = $10.8K (90 paid × $120)
- Month 7: Revenue = $21.6K (180 paid cumulative)
- **Cohort profitability: Month 7**

## Retention & Churn

**Monthly Churn Target:** 3% or less

**Cohort Retention:**
- Month 1-3 (onboarding): 85% retention (15% churn)
- Month 4-12: 97% retention (3% monthly churn)
- Month 13-24: 98% retention (2% monthly churn)
- Month 25+: 99% retention (1% monthly churn - power users locked in)

**Why Low Churn:**
1. **Performance lock-in:** Users with profitable agents won't switch
2. **Risk mitigation:** Agents prevent emotional trading losses
3. **Time savings:** Automation frees up 10+ hours/week
4. **Marketplace stickiness:** Users publishing strategies have revenue share
5. **Regulatory moat:** Licensed, compliant alternative = hard to replicate

**Churn Mitigation Tactics:**
1. **30-day paper trading trial:** Proves value before payment
2. **Progressive risk caps:** Reduces fear, builds confidence
3. **Weekly performance reports:** Reinforces value via email/Slack
4. **Community engagement:** Discord, office hours, educational content
5. **Agent versioning:** Continuous improvements keep users engaged

## Expansion Revenue (Net Dollar Retention)

**Target NDR:** 125%+

**Expansion Mechanisms:**
1. **Tier upgrades:** 25% of Basic → Pro within 6 months (+$200/mo)
2. **Additional agents:** Pro users activate 3-5 agents (+$0-$300/mo via marketplace)
3. **Fund accounts:** Small funds add team members (+$500-$2,000/mo)
4. **Performance fees:** High-volume traders pay execution fees (+10-15 bps)
5. **Marketplace participation:** Strategy publishers earn 70%, drive engagement

**Expansion Math (Example User):**
- Month 1-6: Basic tier = $99/mo = $594 revenue
- Month 7-12: Upgrades to Pro = $299/mo = $1,794 revenue
- Month 13-18: Adds marketplace strategy (+$100/mo our take) = $2,394 revenue
- Month 19-24: Invites team member (+$299/mo) = $6,582 revenue
- **Year 2 Revenue: $6,582 vs Year 1 Revenue: $2,388 = 276% NDR**

**Realistic Blended NDR:**
- Not all users expand
- Assume 40% of users expand by average $50/mo in Year 2
- Base cohort: $120/mo × 12 = $1,440
- Expanded cohort: ($120 + $20) × 12 = $1,680
- NDR: $1,680 / $1,440 = **117%** (conservative)
- With high performers: **125-140% NDR**

## Economic Model Validation

**Scenario Analysis:**

**Best Case (30% probability):**
- CAC: $40 (viral growth)
- LTV: $5,000 (low churn, high upsells)
- Ratio: 125:1
- Result: $100M ARR by Year 3

**Base Case (50% probability):**
- CAC: $60
- LTV: $3,600
- Ratio: 60:1
- Result: $55M ARR by Year 3

**Worst Case (20% probability):**
- CAC: $150 (organic doesn't work, paid ads required)
- LTV: $2,000 (high churn, low conversions)
- Ratio: 13:1
- Result: $15M ARR by Year 3

**Key Assumption Sensitivities:**
1. **Broker connect rate:** 60% → 80% = +33% revenue
2. **Paper-to-paid conversion:** 60% → 75% = +25% revenue
3. **Monthly churn:** 3% → 5% = -40% LTV
4. **Avg subscription price:** $120 → $150 = +25% LTV

**Conclusion:** Even worst-case scenario (13:1 LTV:CAC) is healthy by SaaS standards. Base case (60:1) is exceptional.
