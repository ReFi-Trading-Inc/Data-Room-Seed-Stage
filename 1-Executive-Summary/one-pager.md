## The Problem

76% of active retail traders lose money—not from lack of skill or capital, but from **emotional decision-making**. Manual execution leads to revenge trading, panic selling, and broken risk rules. Existing solutions are inadequate:

- **DIY Scripts:** Fragile, time-consuming, no risk controls
- **Custodial Bots:** Require surrendering funds (post-FTX, unacceptable)
- **Copy Trading:** Black-box strategies with no transparency
- **Robo-Advisors:** Passive-only, not for active traders

**Result:** 15 million active algo traders globally lack institutional-grade automation without custody surrender.

---

## The Solution

**ReFi.Trading** is a **non-custodial reinforcement learning (RL) trading platform** that connects directly to users' existing brokerage accounts via API. Users keep custody at their broker while deploying proven RL agents with cryptographic risk controls.

**Core Innovation:**
- **Proven Performance:** 28.06% CAGR, 2.07 Sharpe ratio (3.1-year backtest)
- **Non-Custodial:** Assets never leave user's broker (IBKR, Questrade, Kraken, Coinbase)
- **Transparent Risk:** Progressive capital caps + zk-VaR proofs + kill switches
- **Regulatory-First:** UAE ADGM licensing pathway (Q2 2026 target)

---

## Market Opportunity

- **TAM:** $18B (15M active retail algo traders globally)
- **SAM:** $600M (500K serious traders seeking professional tools)
- **SOM Year 1:** $6M (5,000 users @ $100/month avg)

**Target Segments:**
1. Power-retail traders (active, $25K+ accounts)
2. Technical prosumers (quants, engineers building own systems)
3. Lean funds (<$100M AUM, seeking infrastructure)
