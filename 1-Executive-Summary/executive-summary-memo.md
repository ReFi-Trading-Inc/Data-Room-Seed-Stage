# Executive Summary Memo

**Date:** December 2025  
**Company:** ReFi.Trading Inc.  
**Stage:** Seed Round  
**Incorporated:** Alberta, Canada (2025)  
**Website:** https://refi.trading

## The Opportunity

ReFi.Trading is building the first transparent, non-custodial algorithmic trading platform powered by reinforcement learning (RL) agents that connect directly to users' existing brokerage accounts. We're democratizing institutional-grade trading automation for 15 million active retail traders worldwide who currently lack access to sophisticated quantitative strategies without surrendering custody of their assets.

## The Problem

Power retail traders and small fund managers ($10K-$100K portfolios) face a critical gap: they have the capital and skill to trade profitably, but suffer from emotional decision-making, inconsistent execution, and lack of professional infrastructure. Existing solutions force an impossible choice:

- **Manual trading:** Time-consuming, emotionally exhausting, prone to revenge trading and FOMO
- **Custodial bots (Robinhood, 3Commas, Cryptohopper):** Require surrendering fund control, black-box strategies, poor transparency
- **Script-based solutions:** Require technical expertise, lack risk management, no regulatory framework
- **Prop firms/hedge funds:** Require $100K+ minimums, proprietary lock-in, limited transparency

**The market demands professional trading automation with retained custody and full transparency.**

## The Solution

ReFi.Trading offers **non-custodial reinforcement learning agents** that execute pre-backtested strategies directly through users' brokerage accounts (Interactive Brokers, Questrade, Kraken, Coinbase) via SnapTrade API integration. 

**Key Differentiators:**
- **Non-custodial architecture:** Users maintain 100% control of assets at their existing broker
- **Proven performance:** 28.06% CAGR, 2.07 Sharpe ratio over 3.1-year walk-forward backtest (vs 13.8% CAGR, 0.65 Sharpe for buy-and-hold)
- **Transparent risk management:** Real-time VaR limits, maximum drawdown controls, progressive caps
- **Regulatory-first approach:** Pursuing UAE ADGM Category 3A license + Canadian compliance framework
- **Advanced RL technology:** Average-reward RVI-Q learning agents optimized for infinite-horizon market environments

## Market Opportunity

- **TAM:** 15M active retail algo traders globally → $18B market (at $100/month ARPU)
- **SAM:** 500K serious algorithmic traders → $600M addressable market
- **SOM:** 5K users Year 1, 50K users Year 3 → $6M-$60M revenue potential

**Market Timing:** Post-FTX trust crisis + democratization of AI/ML + 76% of retail traders seeking better automation tools creates unprecedented demand for transparent, non-custodial solutions.
